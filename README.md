# Fusion Extension : Menu

### Extend Fusion with a Menu Element.

The Menu Element allows you to display or construct a menu. It contains different menu types for different parts of your site.

There are 3 built in menu types:

**Main Menu**

Allows you to select a WordPress Menu (added under Appearance > Menus) and displays as a dropdown-capable menu bar. This menu is responsive and displays as a Hamburger Menu on mobile devices.

**Stacked Menu**

Allows you to build a list of vertically stacked menu items

**Inline Menu**

Allows you to build a list of horizontally placed menu items
